# arduino-rc-control-pca9685-hold-servo-demo
Arduino program to hold a servo's position when controlled by a joystick.

When using a radio controller (RC) to control servos, the RC joysticks automatically centre. When this happens, the servos also centre.

This code holds the servo position, even if the joysticks centre. The joysticks define the rate and direction of movement of the servo.

Note: At the time of writing this, I may not have enough knowledge or have not searched hard enough to do this in simpler ways.
